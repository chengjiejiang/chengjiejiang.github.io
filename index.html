In particular, I am interested in how this process is modulated by various factors, including world knowledge, contextual constraints, informativity, and individual differences (e.g., cultural backgrounds and personal experiences). I address these questions using both behavioural methods (e.g., standard and bidirectional self-paced reading, eye-tracking) and neural measures (e.g., event-related potentials).</p> </body></html>
