I am currently a PhD student in the School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, under the supervision of [Dr. Ruth Filik](https://psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/Ruth.Filik) and [Dr. Walter van Heuven](https://waltervanheuven.net/).

As a psycholinguist, I study how language comprehenders construct and update mental representations of what they read, and how they generate predictions and pragmatic inferences based on those representations. In particular, I am interested in how this process is modulated by various factors, including world knowledge, contextual constraints, informativity, and individual differences (e.g., cultural backgrounds and personal experiences). I address these questions using both behavioural methods (e.g., standard and bidirectional self-paced reading, eye-tracking) and neural measures (e.g., event-related potentials).
